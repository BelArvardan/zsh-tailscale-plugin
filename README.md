# zsh-tailscale-plugin
This repository is my implementation of an autocomplete plugin for the tailscale CLI.

# Tailscale plugin

This plugin adds auto-completion and aliases for [tailscale](https://www.tailscale.com/).

To use it add `tailscale` to the plugins array in your zshrc file.

```zsh
plugins=(... tailscale)
```
